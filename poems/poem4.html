        <h2>Unworried</h2>
        <p>
          She played today, <br />
          with naught a <br />
          care to weigh. <br />
          Her fur so soft <br />
          Her tail so plait. <br />
          <br />

          As to anything else, <br />
          She hasn’t had a single thought <br />
          Of letting go a pain<br />
          that is beyond words to take. <br />
          Of staying in the moment <br />
          when it’s always slipping away. <br />
          For she always bite nearby thoughts <br />
          <em>gracefully</em>. <br />
          <br />

          How would it be to be <strong><em>Iris</em></strong
          >,<br />
          I wonder, <br />
          not pondering the world <br />
          with questions that <br />
          &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;cannot be answered <br />
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and would never be. <br />
          <br />

          And so, she lies on my lap <br />
          <strong>Unworried</strong> in the shade <br />
          Her purrs a peaceful lullaby <br />
          <br />

          Tell me you love me, <br />
          those deep eyes said. <br />
          <br />

          I wear my sweetest smile, <br />
          my heart dresses in green <br />
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and dances. <br />
