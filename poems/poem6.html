        <h2>Nightlight</h2>
        <p>
          I’ve had a chance to go down a lonely road. <br />
          Now I know I don’t wanna go no more. <br />
          <br />

          I see your pain, I see all our old times, <br />
          And I don’t wanna miss them, <br />
          but I keep reminiscing—<br />
          I see our home in a vision,<br />
          Something to believe in. <br />
          <br />
          powerless. <br />
          Trying something new every day. <br />
          I am powerless. <br />
          <br />
          Throw me to the flames of my other self, <br />
          Watch me unload insecurities and offensive vices. <br />
          Watch me distort your image of me. <br />
          Watch how frail I am. <br />
          Watch me burn. <br />
          <br />

          the more intimate I get, the lower I sink. <br />
          Though I’m scared to get close <br />
          and hating being alone. <br />
          <br />
          You made that big smile, as if nothing’s wrong. <br />
          You smiled through my soul, <br />
          and I’ve never felt so much warmth for your kindness. <br />
          <br />
          Maybe you saved me, or maybe I’m drifting nowhere. <br />
          Maybe it made me realize how hard it is <br />
          to truly change. <br />
          Even hell can feel like home once you’ve settled in. <br />
          <br />
          The funny thing is, all I ever wanted I already had. <br />
          I just had to start again. <br />
          <br />
          You held my hand tightly, as if it were <br />
          the most precious thing to cling onto. <br />
          I held you so proudly. <br />
          <br />
          There are glimpses of heaven in those small moments, <br />
          And it’s comforting <br />
          to know that <br />
          I’m feeling less alone. <br />
